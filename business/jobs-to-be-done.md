When choosing ideas to pursue don't put too much weight on the "Vitamin vs Painkiller" thinking. 
There are very few pain killers that can be solved by indie-hackers. Instead think about what jobs people want to be done.

Creating remarkable products does not come from understanding typical customers. Products must serve core needs, not what people say they want. We should think less about archetypal customers and more about the jobs people want to get done. Customers’ behavior must be observed rather than inquired. Instead of putting fictional Personas, based on common denominators, into the center of design research, we should focus on the jobs people hire the product for. Knowing these jobs helps to define the customer segment and to find a decent solution.

EXAMPLE:


A key idea is that if you focus on the stories of those who switched to you, and those who switch away from you, you can uncover the core jobs through looking at these opposite ends of engagement.
