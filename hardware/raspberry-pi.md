Connecting a PI to a Computer with just an ethernet
=====
You can go headless and connect a PI directly to your computer over ethernet with a "local-link" by using the hostname: "raspberrypi.local". You can also connect it to your router.
Make sure ssh is first enabled either using "sudo raspi-config" or the "ssh" file in /boot. Username is: pi
