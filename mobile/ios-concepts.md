Cocoa Touch is a UI framework for iOS

**Storyboard** is a representation of the UI as a sequence of Scenes connected by Segues

**Scenes** are representations of view controllers and sub views

**Segue** (pronounced "seg-way") represent transitions between two view controllers and can communicate data between view controllers.

The UI is conceptually a stack of screens.

**View Controllers** hold the view hierarchy for a single screen in iOS.
